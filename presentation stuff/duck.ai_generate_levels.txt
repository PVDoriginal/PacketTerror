generate me some levels. I want increasingly more waves and more packets. here is the Rust/Bevy match template (note that the float is the time until next enemy, so lower means harder level):

pub fn get_level(level: GameLevels) -> Level {
    return match level {
        GameLevels::Sandbox => Level {
            waves: vec![Wave {
                wave: vec![(PacketType::Basic, 1.)],
            }],
        },
        GameLevels::Easy => Level {
            waves: vec![Wave {
                wave: vec![(PacketType::Basic, 1.)],
            }],
        },
        GameLevels::Medium => Level {
            waves: vec![Wave {
                wave: vec![(PacketType::Basic, 1.)],
            }],
        },
        GameLevels::Hard => Level {
            waves: vec![Wave {
                wave: vec![(PacketType::Basic, 1.)],
            }],
        },
        GameLevels::Expert => Level {
            waves: vec![Wave {
                wave: vec![(PacketType::Basic, 1.)],
            }],
        },
    };
}

note that these are the packet trypes, the lower being more difficult:
pub enum PacketType {
    Basic,
    Mid,
    Advanced,
}


GPT-4o mini:
To create increasingly challenging levels in your Rust/Bevy game, we can design each level to have more waves and more packets, with the difficulty increasing as the level progresses. Below is an example implementation for the `get_level` function that defines five levels: Sandbox, Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert. Each level will have a different number of waves and packets, with the time until the next enemy decreasing as the difficulty increases.

```rust
pub fn get_level(level: GameLevels) -> Level {
    return match level {
        GameLevels::Sandbox => Level {
            waves: vec![Wave {
                wave: vec![(PacketType::Basic, 1.0)],
            }],
        },
        GameLevels::Easy => Level {
            waves: vec![
                Wave {
                    wave: vec![(PacketType::Basic, 1.0)],
                },
                Wave {
                    wave: vec![(PacketType::Basic, 0.8)],
                },
            ],
        },
        GameLevels::Medium => Level {
            waves: vec![
                Wave {
                    wave: vec![(PacketType::Basic, 1.0)],
                },
                Wave {
                    wave: vec![(PacketType::Basic, 0.8)],
                },
                Wave {
                    wave: vec![(PacketType::Mid, 0.6), (PacketType::Basic, 0.6)],
                },
            ],
        },
        GameLevels::Hard => Level {
            waves: vec![
                Wave {
                    wave: vec![(PacketType::Basic, 1.0)],
                },
                Wave {
                    wave: vec![(PacketType::Mid, 0.8)],
                },
                Wave {
                    wave: vec![(PacketType::Mid, 0.6), (PacketType::Basic, 0.6)],
                },
                Wave {
                    wave: vec![(PacketType::Advanced, 0.5), (PacketType::Mid, 0.5)],
                },
            ],
        },
        GameLevels::Expert => Level {
            waves: vec![
                Wave {
                    wave: vec![(PacketType::Basic, 1.0)],
                },
                Wave {
                    wave: vec![(PacketType::Mid, 0.8)],
                },
                Wave {
                    wave: vec![(PacketType::Mid, 0.6), (PacketType::Basic, 0.6)],
                },
                Wave {
                    wave: vec![(PacketType::Advanced, 0.5), (PacketType::Mid, 0.5)],
                },
                Wave {
                    wave: vec![(PacketType::Advanced, 0.4), (PacketType::Mid, 0.4), (PacketType::Basic, 0.4)],
                },
            ],
        },
    };
}
```

### Explanation of Each Level:
- **Sandbox**: A single wave with one basic packet.
- **Easy**: Two waves, the second wave has a slightly shorter time until the next enemy.
- **Medium**: Three waves, introducing mid-level packets and a mix of basic packets.
- **Hard**: Four waves, with more mid and advanced packets, and shorter times until the next enemy.
- **Expert**: Five waves, with a mix of advanced, mid, and basic packets, and the shortest times until the next enemy.

This structure allows for a gradual increase in difficulty, providing players with a more engaging experience as they progress through the levels.

User prompt 2 of 2 - 6/10/2025, 10:01:20 AM:
do you think the sintax for adding waves is super long/annoying? Also, add like 5 packets per wave, not just 1-2.

GPT-4o mini:
Yes, the syntax for adding waves can be a bit verbose, especially when you have multiple packets per wave. To streamline the process and make it easier to read, you can create a helper function to generate waves with multiple packets. This will reduce redundancy and improve clarity.

Here's an updated version of the `get_level` function that includes five packets per wave and uses a helper function to simplify wave creation:

```rust
pub fn get_level(level: GameLevels) -> Level {
    fn create_wave(packets: Vec<(PacketType, f32)>) -> Wave {
        Wave { wave: packets }
    }

    return match level {
        GameLevels::Sandbox => Level {
            waves: vec![create_wave(vec![(PacketType::Basic, 1.0)])],
        },
        GameLevels::Easy => Level {
            waves: vec![
                create_wave(vec![(PacketType::Basic, 1.0), (PacketType::Basic, 1.0), (PacketType::Basic, 1.0), (PacketType::Basic, 1.0), (PacketType::Basic, 1.0)]),
                create_wave(vec![(PacketType::Basic, 0.8), (PacketType::Basic, 0.8), (PacketType::Basic, 0.8), (PacketType::Basic, 0.8), (PacketType::Basic, 0.8)]),
            ],
        },
        GameLevels::Medium => Level {
            waves: vec![
                create_wave(vec![(PacketType::Basic, 1.0), (PacketType::Basic, 1.0), (PacketType::Basic, 1.0), (PacketType::Basic, 1.0), (PacketType::Basic, 1.0)]),
                create_wave(vec![(PacketType::Basic, 0.8), (PacketType::Basic, 0.8), (PacketType::Basic, 0.8), (PacketType::Basic, 0.8), (PacketType::Basic, 0.8)]),
                create_wave(vec![(PacketType::Mid, 0.6), (PacketType::Mid, 0.6), (PacketType::Basic, 0.6), (PacketType::Basic, 0.6), (PacketType::Basic, 0.6)]),
            ],
        },

                create_wave(vec![(PacketType::Mid, 0.6), (PacketType::Mid, 0.6), (PacketType::Basic, 0.6), (PacketType::Basic, 0.6), (PacketType::Basic, 0.6)]),
                create_wave(vec![(PacketType::Advanced, 0.5), (PacketType::Advanced, 0.5), (PacketType::Mid, 0.5), (PacketType::Mid, 0.5), (PacketType::Basic, 0.5)]),
